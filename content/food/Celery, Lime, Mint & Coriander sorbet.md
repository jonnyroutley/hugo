**Yield:** About 800ml of sorbet

**Cook Time:** 30 mins prep, 30 mins in ice cream machine + time in freezer


Attempted reacreation of a sorbet I had at a dessert bar in Beijing.


## Ingredients

  

- 250 ml Water
- 200g Caster Sugar
- 6 Limes
- 400g Celery 
- 15g Mint (leaves + stalks)
- 15g Coriander (leaves + stalks)
- 1/2 tsp Salt



## Method

Make syrup, blend ingredients, strain, freeze.

1. Roughly tear up the mint and coriander and add to a small saucepan along with the water, sugar and the zest of 2 of the limes. 
2. Heat the mixture over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar is dissolved. Wait until at a rolling boil and then turn of the heat and put the pan aside to cool to room temp.
3. Meanwhile, juice the limes, and wash and roughly chop the celery into small chunks - it will be blended so size isn't so important. 
4. When the syrup is cool enough, pour it into a blender (keeping the herbs in there) along with the celery, salt and most of the lime juice.
5. Blend on high speed for about a minute or until the mixture is completely homogenous. Taste and add extra lime juice, mint or coriander as necessary - all the flavours should be distinct.
6. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve, pressing with a spoon to help all the liquid get through. 
7. Add the liquid to an ice cream machine and churn for ~30 mins, then put in a freezable container and freeze for a few hours. If you don't have an ice cream machine, you can put the liquid straight in the freezer and run a fork through it every hour or so until the texture is right, or freeze the block solid and put it into a food processor after.
