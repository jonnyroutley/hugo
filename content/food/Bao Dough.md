## Ingredients

  

- 350g All-Purpose White Flour 
- 2 Tsp Baking Powder
- 2 Tsp Dried Yeast
- 50g Caster Sugar
- 1 Tsp Salt
- 1 Tbsp Sesame Oil
- 175ml Water (Lukewarm)
- Filling of Your Choice



## Method

Make the dough, fill, steam.

1. Add the flour, baking powder, yeast, sugar and salt to a large mixing bowl. 
2. Add the sesame oil and water to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough starts to form. 
3. Knead the dough (in the bowl or on a floured work surface) for 10 minutes until the dough is smooth.
4. Return to the dough to the bowl and cover with clingfilm - set aside in a warm place for 30 mins until the dough has doubled in size.
5. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and cut the dough into two equal pieces.
6. Roll each of these pieces into a 30cm log shape, then cut each of the logs into four equal pieces. Roll all the pieces into balls.
7. Take one of the balls, flatten with the palm of your hand and then use a small rolling pin to shape each piece into a ~10cm diameter circle.
8. Fill a small bowl with water, and use it to wet a finger and run it around the outer rim of the dough. 
9. Place a heaped tablespoon of filling inside the centre of the circle.
10. [Fold the dumpling !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3FYCE5DHH4) 
11. Don't worry if they don't look as good as the ones in the vid - main thing is to make sure the top is sealed.
12. Cut a sheet of parchment paper into ~5x5cm squares or large enough to cover the bottom of each filled bao. 
13. Arrange as many buns inside a steamer basket as possible whilst leaving a 2cm gap between each bun to allow for rising. Let the buns rest for 20 mins.
14. In the meantime, fill a pot a quarter full with water, and heat until boiling.
15. Cover the steamer basket with a lid and place over the pot - steam over a high heat for 20 minutes. Repeat for the rest of the bao as necessary.
