**Yield:** 4 servings

**Cook Time:** 1 hour


A chicken (or pork) cutlet and egg rice bowl. 


## Ingredients


- 500ml Dashi
  
- 4 Skinless/Boneless Chicken Thighs

- Soy Sauce

- Mirin

- 1 Large (or 2 Small) White Onions

- Spring Onion Top (optional)

- Plain White Flour

- Panko Breadcrumbs

- 10 Eggs

- Neutral Cooking Oil

- Medium Grain Rice



## Method

Make dashi, fry chicken, assemble the don. 

1. Start by preparing the dashi - cut the onion(s) into slices, add to a saucepan and then cover with water and add dashi powder as per the instructions. Bring to a simmer, adding soy sauce and mirin to taste (probably 2-3 tbsps of each) until lightly seasoned. Keep simmering on the side.

2. Cook your rice ! 2-3 cups depending on appetite. 

3. Fill a pot of your desired size with enough cooking oil to deep-fry and start heating it.

4. Set out three bowls/plates for the breading of the chicken - one with panko, one with two eggs beaten well and one with flour. Season the flour with salt and black pepper. 

5. Trim any excess fat/gristle from the chicken thighs and then use a mallet to pound it into a uniform thickness (around 1/2 an inch). Coat each piece of chicken in flour, then egg, then panko. 

6. Test the oil by sprinkling a few pieces of panko into it - it should sizzle but not burn (if using a thermometer I think aim for around 160Â°C). Fry each piece of chicken for around 5-6 minutes, flipping once or twice until deep golden brown all over. Drain the katsu on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle it with some more salt while still hot.

7. Take a ladle full of dashi and pour it into a small frying pan - make sure to have a good amount of liquid/onions and get the pan simmering gently. Cut a piece of katsu into slices and beat 2 eggs in a separate bowl. Lay the sliced katsu onto the dashi, pour the egg over/around it and place a lid on top of the pan to steam the egg. 

8. Scoop a portion of rice into a large bowl and once cooked, slide the katsu/egg out of the pan and on to the rice. Top with thinly sliced spring onion greens.

9. Repeat steps 7 & 8 until you have used all the katsu !
