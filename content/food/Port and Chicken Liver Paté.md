A recipe to use up any spare chicken livers that come with whole chickens or carcasses. Spread on toast or use for banh mi.


## Ingredients

  

- 300g Chicken Livers

- 1 Banana Shallot or 2-4 Regular (depending on size)

- 1 Garlic Clove

- Zest from 1 Orange

- 1 tsp Thyme Leaves

- 1/4 tsp Ground Ginger

- 1/2 tsp Salt

- 50ml Double Cream

- 50ml Port

- 150g Unsalted Butter



## Method

Clean livers, fry, blend, top with butter, set. 

1. Rinse then soak the livers in cold water for 10 mins or so. Pat dry then remove any excess gristle/fat and cut into 1.5cm pieces. 

2. Finely dice the shallot and garlic clove, and run a knife through the thyme leaves.

3. Add a knob of butter to a pan over medium heat. Add the shallot, garlic and thyme and fry until fragrant and softened.

4. Add the livers and fry until they're browned nicely all over, but still pink in the middle. 

5. Add the port and deglaze the pan, letting the port simmer until it reduces and becomes nice and thick. 

6. Transfer everything to a blender, add the zest, ginger, cream and salt and blend until smooth. 

7. Add 90g of the butter and blend until smooth again - taste and adjust seasoning. 

8. Pass the blended mixture through a sieve into a container and chill for 30 mins. 

9. Melt the remaining butter in a small pan and top the paté with it. Return to the fridge and let firm up for a few hours.
