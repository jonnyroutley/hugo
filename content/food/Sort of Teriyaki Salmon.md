**Cook Time:** 20 mins + marinade time


A _sort of_ teriyaki-style dish (garlic/ginger not traditional) that is pretty easy to improvise with. The measurments are rough - just try to keep the ratio equal.

## Ingredients

- 500g Salmon fillet

- 2 tbsp {{% tooltip %}}Fermented Garlic Honey{{% definition %}}Mix a head of peeled garlic cloves with a jar of raw honey and let sit at room temp, stirring every few days for at least a week before using.{{% /definition %}}{{% /tooltip %}}
  
- 2 tbsp Soy Sauce

- 2 tbsp Mirin

- 2.5cm piece Ginger

- 1 tsp Sesame Oil


## Method

Prepare marinade, let sit, grill.

1. Grate the ginger into a bowl or ziplock bag and add all of the liquids, adjusting to taste/adding more as necessary to cover the fish.
   
2. If using a single large piece of salmon, make 3 shallow cuts on the skin side to allow the marinade to get in evenly.
   
3. Set the bowl/bag aside in the fridge for at least 30 mins, up to a few hours.
   
4. Take the bowl/bag out the fridge to allow it to get to room temperature and start to preheat your oven.
   
5. Line a baking tray with foil, allowing a large lip on each side and lay out the salmon, pouring the marinade over the top.
   
6.  Bake at 200Â° for around 15 minutes until mostly cooked (check early) then spoon the sauce over the top and grill for the last few minutes until you have a nice dark glaze on the top. Be careful not to burn the sauce (the sugars from the honey will start to darken quickly).
