Checking in for the first time in a while (see: log). 
It's the 6th of October 2019 and tomorrow morning I'm heading up to Oxford to start my undergrad degree. That's pretty crazy to me! I have freshers week then am back on Friday for James and Rosie's wedding on the Saturday which is really exciting. I think I'll write more about Summer and where I'm at now in a differnt post, but to keep up an old tradition, here are my goals for the coming year:

- Be outgoing, confident, kind - remember that you're a year older and more well equipped so make the first move and don't be shy with new people!
- Get into a good routine in terms of sleep, going out, work and extra-curriculars
- Go to life class
- Start learning Mandarin
- Establish a group of good friends
- Be a good friend to those around you - especially old friends. Make an effort to keep in touch with people as everyone spreads out
- Eat much less meat
- Get a yoga/gym/running routine set
- Run either a half or full marathon
- Get a 2.1 or above
- Find what work I really enjoy and start to focus in on those subjects
- Travel to somewhere great (and do more UK travel)
- Don't get cocky or arrogant - Oxford will be filled with people you know already and like and it'll be easy to feel like the man
- Learn how to cook a proper french omelette
- Cook (and maybe eat?) a whole fish
- Get involved to some degree with a college sport - even if just trying out
- Play a lot of croquet if possible
- Visit friends at other unis 
- Make clothes 
- Bind a book
- Play more music (maybe pick up the clarinet again)
