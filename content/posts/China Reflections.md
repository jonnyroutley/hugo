I travelled for three months this Summer, half of which I spent in China. Here are some of my thoughts adapted from the notebook I kept along the way. 

I'm sitting at the bar in my hostel in Kunming, 4 nights before I leave China. I've been here since May 28th (nearly 6 weeks) and I think this writing is an attempt to form some of the feelings I've had since coming here - mainly centred around identity.

By nature of travelling alone, you often find yourself in conversations with strangers (usually other backpackers).  Understandably, one of the first questions that gets asked is: 

'So... why China?' 

'Why China' indeed. China is alluring in many ways - it's massive, and so really just has everything you can imagine - gigantic cities, breathtaking landscapes and everything in-between. The food goes without saying. It's also a slightly more interesting choice than the typical SE Asia circuit (although, that _is_ up next and I am v excited), or at least it's on fewer peoples' itineraries. The crux of the question/answer really is that in coming here I wanted to see China - Chinese people - and understand where my mum's family comes from and what that means for me. 

My dad is English, and my mum is Chinese Malaysian ie. she was born and grew up in Malaysia, and my grandparents are still there, but their families came from China (I think 4 generations above me?). I think they came from Guangdong/Fujian provinces, neither of which I actually visited during this trip. I want to come back and visit them soon. 

I guess this is where some of the confusion starts: when asked where my family comes from, as a kid and still now to an extent, it was hard to know whether I should say Malaysia, China, both, or something else entirely. This complexity then goes up when someone asks me where _I_ am from (answer: London). 

I guess this trip was about understanding if there was anything here that could help me answer some of these questions. I wonder if there was also a sense of needing something to legitimise myself also - I don't speak Chinese, don't know what the country/culture/history is like so I find myself wondering if that makes myself less Chinese? (I don't know much English history either...) 

So what do I think of China? The people are interesting - hard to generalise to a great degree but often people have been kind and willing to go out of their way to help (directions, trying to speak English with you etc.) That being said, the manners here are different - rude is different. Mainly things like spitting, cutting nails, queueing, personal space etc.

On looking Chinese - this is a weird one. Some people can tell I'm foreign (maybe mannerisms, dress sense) but often people assume I speak Chinese then look confused when I mumble out an apology. It goes the same way - western tourists assume I'm Chinese on the most part. I've become less bothered about it but I think part of me feels shame that I can't speak Chinese.

On food - this is probably my biggest tie. I have a Chinese stomach. I'm fascinated by the food here - lots of new discoveries, but also so many familiar favourites. This makes me feel connected but it's also a complex one: everything tastes familiar but also the food I've eaten growing up has mainly been cantonese/malay food which is very different to the food in the parts of china I've been travelling. 

I guess the question is 'do I feel more Chinese?' Who/what am I? I think I have a stronger understanding now of China, Chinese people, the culture, traditions etc. I feel like I can talk more confidently about it. But this is not really me or my identity - at least for now. It is too unfamilar and alien. I came here looking for a way in - to legitimise calling myself Chinese or to find a way to make myself feel more in touch with this side. I think it has done more to highlight the differences, the unknowns - it is important to know some background, my grandparents' identities, but really this has helped me see that all I am is myself - half English, half Chinese-Malaysian, but fully something else in it's own right. It's funny to me that I had to go halfway around the world to figure that out. Maybe there's something disappointing 

In looking far and wide for something else - an answer - I found that it is not out there, but apparent to me already, I think I find this comforting.
